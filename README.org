** Introduction

Through the software solution presented in this paper, we provide a method to interact with IDQ's Quantis Appliance network-attached device---a quantum random number generator that securely
generates high-quality random numbers [cite:@noauthor_quantis_nodate]---through REST API. We deliver an easy-to-extend solution for various programming languages and integrated projects. As such,
our solution's implementation supports the straightforward use of quantum-generated random numbers in applications and research areas in which the output of the experiments is highly dependent on
the quality of random numbers.

In the current form, /libqrng/ offers access to IDQ's Quantis Appliance through an API that can be easily integrated into applications that need true random numbers. The library is written in C language
and is currently available as a library only on GNU/Linux-based operating systems. We decided to implement it as a library in native C since, to the best of our knowledge, it can be easily used with
other programming languages via Foreign Function Interface (FFI). As a proof of concept, we implement Python bindings to /libqrng/ and provide examples of how to request random numbers from IDQ's device.

We designed the software stack we provide to be easily extended to different scientific programming languages and scientific/engineering fields, such as 
cryptography[cite:@bruce1996applied], Monte-Carlo methods[cite:@ferrenberg1992monte],  heuristic algorithms[cite:@navarro2022review], industrial testing and labeling, hazard games, [cite:@stipvcevic2011quantum], etc. 


** Software Architecture


IDQ's Quantis Appliance device is connected to the Local Area Network so that the random bytes are retrieved using REST APIs via HTTPS protocol.
As we show in Figure [[fig:archblock]], our proposed solution for using the IDQ's Quantis Appliance devices comprises 3 software layers: the /libqrng/ library (which uses /libcurl/ to request
data from the device by GET requests), the Foreign Function Interface used for calling the library API from different programming languages (currently we support the Python programming language by utilizing
the Python extension), and the Application Layer (for which we provide application examples that use the library directly or through the Foreign Function Interface).

Our /libqrng/ is a shared object that exports APIs to request random bytes from the IDQ Quantis Appliance. Figure [[fig:libqrng_init]] presents the library's initialization sequence.
As shown, the library uses /libcurl/ to perform network requests. The ~device_domain_address~ parameter is mandatory since it represents the IP address of the quantum random generator device.
Figures [[fig:libqrng_stream]], [[fig:libqrng_double]], and [[fig:libqrng_int]] present the sequences that retrieve the random bytes from the device and perform an interaction with /libcurl/.
The API to get a stream of random bytes, as shown in Figure [[fig:libqrng_stream]], is ~qrng_random_stream~ and accepts 2 parameters: the ~stream~ buffer that stores the bytes,
and the ~size~ of the requested stream. The APIs for getting random integers (32-bit or 64-bit integers) or doubles (float or double values), as presented in Figures [[fig:libqrng_double]]
and [[fig:libqrng_int]], accept 4 parameters: ~min~ (inclusive) and ~max~ (exclusive) that represent the number's range, ~samples~ that represent the number of requested samples,
and ~buffer~ that stores the values. Figure [[fig:libqrng_close]] presents the cleanup sequence.

** Getting started

*** Prerequisites

**** Operating System

+ Linux based distribution

**** Dependencies
+ gcc (GNU C Compiler)
+ libc (GNU C Library)
+ Make
+ libcurl-dev  
+ Python

*** Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.

   ~git clone https://github.com/sebastianardelean/libqrng.git~

2. Change directory to ~src~.

   ~cd src~
   
3. Build and install the /libqrng/ library.

   ~make && make install~

The make script will build the library and create the shared object. The install target will copy the shared object libqrng.so.1.0 to ~/usr/local/lib~ and will create the symlinks to
~/usr/local/lib/libqrng.so.1.0~ and ~/usr/local/lib/libqrng.so~.

The Python FFI is *not built and installed by default*. To use the Python bindings, first build and install succcessfully /libqrng/ following the above mentioned steps. Then, the next steps must be followed:

1. Change directory to ~bindings/python~.

   ~cd bindings/python~

2. Build and install.

   ~make && make install~

Another option to install the /libqrng/ library is to download the amd64 binaries provided as deb packages (only if you're using Debian based Linux distributions) or as tar.gz archives. The deb package can be installed using
~dpkg -i package_name~.

If you choose to use the tar.gz archive:

1. Extract the content of the archive.
   ~tar -xvf archive_name~

2. Make the install script executable.
   ~chmod +x install.sh~

3. Run the install script. The install script will copy the shared object to ~/usr/lib/~, create the symlinks and run ~ldconfig~.
   ~./install.sh~
   

*Note* The amd64 binaries provided for download do not include the Python binding library!

** Examples

In ~examples~ directory we provide examples of using each API of the library. As such, we provide the following examples:

1. ~fwversion~ to get the firmware version.
2. ~randbytestream~ to request streams of random bytes.
3. ~randdouble~ to request random double values.
4. ~randfloat~ to request random float values.
5. ~randint32~ to request random 32-bit integer values.
6. ~randint64~ to request random 64-bit integer values.
7. ~sysinfo~ to request the system informations.
8. ~knapsack-ga~ presents the use of the Python bindings and ~libqrng~ to implement the genetic algorithm for solving the knapsack problem.
9. ~simulated-annealing~ presents the use of the Python bindings and ~libqrng~ to implement the simulated annealing.
10. ~qrand~ is a command-line tool that uses all the capabilities of the ~libqrng~ to request random values.
